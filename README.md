## Abstract

This paper conducts experiments to measure TCP and UDP performance on 5G heterogeneous network (HetNet) environment by setting various numbers of User Equipments (UEs) from 10 to 50 and file sizes from 100B to 500B. The performance is evaluated by packet delay, throughput, inter-packet gap, and packet loss ratio. Additionally, this paper investigates handover recovery time and discusses the ping-pong effect. Experimental results demonstrate that TCP maintains high reliability and stable latency, while UDP shows high loss rate reaching up to 88% as the number of UEs increases. Finally, limitations of TCP and UDP protocols are identified, and QUIC is proposed as an optimized alternative through a literature review, highlighting its potential for reduced handover latency and ping-pong rate.
