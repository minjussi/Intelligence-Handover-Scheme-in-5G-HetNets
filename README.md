## Abstract

This paper is going to conduct experiments to measure TCP and UDP performance on 5G heterogeneous network environment by setting various numbers of UEs and file sizes. The performance is evaluated by packet delay, throughput, inter-packet gap, download time and packet loss ratio. Additionally, this paper tries to reveal the limitations of TCP and UDP through Handover Recovery Time and its effect on reducing Ping-Pong Rate. Finally, it finds the optimized protocol by conducting a literature review on QUIC.
