The simulations/NR/filetransfer folder includes simulation examples that are intended to provide
hints about the basic configurations of 5G NR networks.

The omnetpp.ini file is composed of several sections, each of which extends the scenario provided
by the previous one. This way, the beginner user is provided with a step-by-step guide towards 
scenarios with increasing complexities.    

All the configurations use the FileTransferNet network that can be found in the
simulations/NR/filetransfer/FileTransferNet.ned



===== (1) Single-UE =====

This simple scenario simulates only one UE attached to one gNB, with downlink traffic. The UE is 
located 400 meters far from the gNB and receives 800 kbps CBR traffic from a remote server.  

Since this scenario does not include any inter-cell interference and the gNB is lightly loaded
(it is serving one UE only), you will observe that the throughput received by the UE is equal 
to the throughput generated by the server. 
See 'cbrReceivedThroughput:mean' and 'cbrGeneratedThroughput:mean' statistics.
